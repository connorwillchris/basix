# BASIX

A linux shell and programming language for the blind.

## External Libraries

Uses `espeak-ng` for speech synthesis. Other libraries may be used.

## Compiling

Uses xmake. Install xmake on windows, linux or MacOS. This is designed to be the easiest build system, but other build systems are
given as well to make compilation as smooth as possible.

Type `xmake` in the current directory and it should build this project for your target platform.

## Supported Platforms

None yet, still in early pre-alpha.
