# BASIX

A linux shell and programming language for the blind.

## External Libraries

Uses `espeak-ng` for speech synthesis. Other libraries may be used.

## Compiling

Compilation has been designed to be as simple as possible. Uses xmake. Install xmake on windows, linux or MacOS. This is designed to be the easiest build system, but other build systems are given as well to make compilation as smooth as possible.

### Xmake

This is typically the simplest for Windows and Linux systems. Type `xmake` in the project directory in your shell or command line, and it will compile.

### Cmake

Type...
```
mkdir build
cmake ..
```
on Linux. On Windows, pray to whatever god you believe in.

### Makefile
